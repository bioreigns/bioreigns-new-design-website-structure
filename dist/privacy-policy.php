                                children's privacy and safety online.</p>

                            <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United
                                States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of
                                data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
                                Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy
                                laws that protect personal information.</p>

                                the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</h5>

                            <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the
                                right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail
                                to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable
                                rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government
                                agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
