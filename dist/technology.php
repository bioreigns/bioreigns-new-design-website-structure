                            <p>Our Laboratory partner has developed the only true water dissolvable CBD complex. These products are formed with pharmaceutical technology used in circumstances of increasing vital water insoluble protein for patients that
                                are ill. Unlike the competition, there is no nano complex, which merely disperses small clusters (nano-size) of CBD molecules in an otherwise insoluble mixture. Eventually, all nano products will separate, like oil and
                                water, providing minimal bioavailability.</p>

                            </h2>
                            <p>Our solubilization tool, is safe, stable and omni potent because of the increase in bioavailability. The Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) predicts oral drug absorption based on the chemical’s aqueous solubility
                                and intrinsic permeability through the gastrointestinal mucosa. Studies have been shown that Cannabinoids have limited water solubility, considered as “BCS class II”. These studies demonstrate why our CBD and Curcumin complex
                                is the best solution to absorb into the human body. Our bodies are made up of approximately 65% water and in order for us to readily absorb materials we need to consume 100% water based CBD and Curcumin.
